to run this code -------
First task is install npm .
run-> npm install 
then -> 
install  dependencis 
(because i forget to install all dependencies
in --save mode )
then ->
goto server folder
run->    npm run dev
then->
goto client folder
run->  npm run dev



i have a docker file but have some 
issue in my docker file . The problem is 
RUN npm install takes more time to install.
Can't find out the problem. 
if you resolve the problem then
run->  
"docker-compose up ems_client" to run this app into docker
