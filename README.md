to run this code -------
The first task is to install npm.
run-> "npm install" 
then -> 
install  dependencies 
(because I forgot to install all the dependencies
in --save mode )
then ->
goto server folder
run->    "npm run dev"
then->
goto client folder
run->  "npm run dev"



I have a docker file but have some 
issues in my docker file. 
Can't find out the problem.
After running docker it says "This page isn't working right now" 
if you resolve the problem then
run->  
"docker-compose up ems_client" to run this app into the docker.
