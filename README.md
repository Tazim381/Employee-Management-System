to run this code -------
The first task is to install npm.
run-> "npm install" 
then -> 
install  dependencies 
(because I forgot to install all the dependencies
in --save mode )
then ->
goto server folder
run->    "npm run dev"
then->
goto client folder
run->  "npm run dev"



I have a docker file but have some 
issues in my docker file. The problem is 
RUN npm install takes more time to install.
Can't find out the problem. 
if you resolve the problem then
run->  
"docker-compose up ems_client" to run this app into the docker.
